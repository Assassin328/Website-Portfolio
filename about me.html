    <div class="about">
        <div>
            <p>I have been into technology since I was a kid. I always loved video games and I got very competitive in first-person shooter video games. My avid love for video games sparked my interest in learning how they were made. I go to a collaborative college high school, which allows me to take classes that are interesting to me, so I have taken as many programming courses as possible to learn as many languages as I could. By the time I graduate, I will have learned the basics of Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I intend to continue my education to get a bachelor’s in computer science.</p>
